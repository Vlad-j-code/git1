Looking back at me, I see that I never really got it right
I never stopped to think of you
I'm always wrapped up in things I cannot win
You are the antidote that gets me by
Somethin' strong, like a drug, that gets me high
What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold
What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so
Cold to you, I'm sorry 'bout all the lies
Maybe in a different light
You can see me stand on my own again
'Cause now I can see
You are the antidote that got me by
Somethin' strong, like a drug, that got me high
